This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Idea

I want to use a real API in the future where I can fetch real dogs and cats that need a new home. This way people could find an easier way to get their next pet and help them.
